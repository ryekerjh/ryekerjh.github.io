      <h3 class="section-title">What even
        <em>is</em> Git?</h3>
      <p>I'm glad you asked! Git is a program that you download for your computer to use. It's one and only job is to keep track
        of folders and files that you tell it to track. Once you learn how to use it properly, Git will ensure that you never
        lose code to hardware failures, accidental deletion, or any other unfortunate mishaps. After all, Git happens!</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h3 class="section-title">Well then what's Github?</h3>
      <p>Another excellent question! Github (or more correctly:
        <a href="https://www.github.com">github.com</a>) is a website that offers free services to software developers. Using Git (the program on your computer)
        you can access free cloud-based storage for your code, get free web hosting, and keep infinite versions of your code,
        safely stored on someone else's dime. Pretty Sweet!</p>

      <h3 class="section-title">What you need to know for JS1</h3>
      <p>In the Javascript for Beginners course, we emphasize using Git and Github because as a developer, you'll be using
        <em>some</em> form of version control, guaranteed. Below I have outlined all of the things you'll need to know about
        git and github to begin day 1 of Intro to Javascript. Read each of the articles below and our summary of how you'll
        use them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is">Git branches</a>
          <p>Branches are a
            <em>huge</em> asset to us as Front End Developers. Essentially, a branch is a copy of your code that you can edit
            without changing the original version of the code. In our class, we will have 1 repository that we use for the
            duration of the class. Each day at the beginning of class, we will create a new branch for that day's lessons.
            That way, you can maintain a "clean" copy of your code base (the starting point with no code written) and create
            a new branch for the different lessons (where you can write subject-specific notes.) The commands we will issue
            in our terminal in class each day to create our new branch are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <pre><code>
  cd path/to/your/class/folder
                    </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <pre><code>
  git checkout -b day-of-class
                    </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>It should return a message similar to this</p>
              <img src="../img/checkout-result.png" alt="Checkout Result" class="img-responsive">

          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Pull Requests</a>
          <p>Pull requests are how we re-unify (or merge) our branches back together. So once you're done with your take home
            practice excersizes, you can merge the branch into your gh-pages branch so your instructor can test the functionality
            of the code in real time. Read up on gh-pages branches below if you don't know what they are or what they do.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://pages.github.com/">gh-pages</a> branches
          <p>Have you ever built a website and wanted to show it off but didn't want to pay for web hosting? Lucky for you,
            github.com offers
            <em>free</em> web hosting! You can't pick the name of your website, but if you just want to show off your skills
            or show a client your progress on their website without paying a hosting company, this is your best bet. As far
            as how we're going to use the gh-pages branch, it will be for testing your take home code. Each night after class,
            you will create a new branch for your take home excersize, create the program for that class, and test it to
            make sure it works. Once you're satisfied with it, you will create a Pull Request on github.com with your take
            home branch as the
            <b>compare</b> and your gh-pages branch as the
            <b>base</b>. That way, your instructor can test your work as well as look over the code itself.</p>

        <li>
          <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/merge-conflicts">Merge conflicts</a>
          <p>While we never
            <em>want</em> merge conflicts to happen, they sometimes do. Because of this, you should read up on what they are
            and how to resolve them. </p>
