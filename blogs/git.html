          <h3 class="section-title">What even <em>is</em> Git?</h3>
          <p>I'm glad you asked! Git is a program that you download for your computer to use. It's one and only job is to keep track of folders and files that you tell it to track. Once you learn how to use it properly, Git will ensure that you never lose code to hardware failures, accidental deletion, or any other unfortunate mishaps. After all, Git happens!</p>

        <div class="container">
          <h3 class="section-title">Well then what's Github?</h3>
          <p>Another excellent question! Github (or more correctly: <a href="https://www.github.com">github.com</a>) is a website that offers free services to software developers. Using Git (the program on your computer) you can access free cloud-based storage for your code, get free web hosting, and keep infinite versions of your code, safely stored on someone else's dime. Pretty Sweet!</p>

          <p>In the Javascript for Beginners course, we emphasize using Git and Github because as a developer, you'll be using <em>some</em> form of version control, guaranteed. Below is a step-by-step setup guide for getting ready for day 1 of class, but here are the concepts you need to be familiar with, along with links to learn more, <em>before</em> day 1 of class:</p>
